# rpg-game
2D RPG Game made using Godot.
Game is not finished or published, got burnt out on this project.
Currently player moving, combat, hp, xp, respawning, inventory system and skill system all work, they're just very barebones.
Still I enjoyed making this game and I learnt a lot on game design, gdscript and overall programming. 

Some assets from https://opengameart.org/content/16x16-game-assets by George Bailey
Some assets I made myself using Aseprite and Gimp.
